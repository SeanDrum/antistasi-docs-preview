# Official Antistasi Community Edition Wiki

Hello and welcome to the Antistasi Guide!

Antistasi is a persistent “capture the island” style campaign for Arma 3. You start out outgunned and under-resourced, and you grow your rebellion over time by looting, completing missions, and taking (and holding) key locations.

This repo is intentionally simple: **Markdown files you can browse directly in GitHub**.

## Guides

We aim to keep the documentation in three “levels”:

- **Beginners Guide** — how to play, what the systems mean, and what to do next.
- **Detailed Reference Guide** — deeper mechanics and numbers (optional).
- **Dev Guide** — developer/admin focused notes (optional).

Right now we’re starting with just one guide:

- **[Beginners Guide](beginners_guide/README.md)**

## Notes

- This guide is a “living” rewrite inspired by the older docs site:
  - [Antistasi Docs index](https://official-antistasi-community.github.io/A3-Antistasi-Docs/index.html)
  - [Beginners Guide (raw)](https://official-antistasi-community.github.io/A3-Antistasi-Docs/beginners_guide/raw_beginners_guide.html#beginners-guide)
