# Antistasi Guide (GitHub Edition)

This is a simple, GitHub-browsable guide to **playing Antistasi** (the scenario), written for casual players.

- New here? Start with **[Getting Started](getting-started/README.md)**.
- Want the “what does this marker do?” answers? Go to **[Map Locations](gameplay/map-locations/README.md)**.
- Not commanding? You can ignore **[Commander](commander/README.md)** entirely.

## Where do I click?

- **Battle Menu**: your main hub (war status, missions, admin/commander actions).
- **Role Selection**: change role perks (rifleman/medic/engineer/TL/commander).
- **HQ actions**: many actions require being near HQ (varies by feature).

If you’re lost, see **[Controls & Menus](reference/controls-and-menus.md)**.
