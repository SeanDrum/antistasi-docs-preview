# First Session (60 minutes)

The fastest way to “get” Antistasi is to focus on **small wins** early: loot, intel, and a safe routine.

## 0–10 minutes: orient

- Find **HQ** (your safe-ish home base).
- Open the **Battle Menu** and look at **War Status** (who’s mad, what’s owned).
- Pick a role you can actually play well (rifleman/medic/engineer).

## 10–30 minutes: get gear + intel

- Loot weapons, radios, and supplies from enemies (don’t expect to start rich).
- Look for opportunities that give **intel** (ask your server/commander what they prefer).
- Keep it quiet. In Antistasi, *how* you fight matters as much as *whether* you win.

## 30–60 minutes: do a mission with a clear goal

Choose something that matches your group size and patience:

- **Destroy / Assassination**: quick “hit and run” content.
- **Convoy ambush**: fun, but can escalate fast—plan an exit.
- **Rescue**: great team objective.
- **Logistics**: not glamorous, but often the difference between progress and stagnation.

See **[Missions](../gameplay/missions.md)** for what each mission type actually means.

## The 3 habits that make campaigns smoother

- **Stash vehicles** instead of abandoning them (see **[Garage & Vehicles](../gameplay/garage-and-vehicles.md)**).
- **Don’t shoot civilians** unless your server explicitly wants chaos.
- **Bring someone who can drive/repair**. Walking everywhere gets old fast.
