# Roles at a glance

Antistasi roles are mostly about **perks and responsibilities**, not forcing you into a rigid class system.

## Good defaults

- **Rifleman**: if you just want to shoot, carry ammo, and learn.
- **Medic**: if you like keeping the squad alive and stabilizing chaos.
- **Engineer**: if you like fixing/handling vehicles and interacting with build/repair mechanics.

## Leadership roles (optional)

- **Team Leader (TL)**: useful if you’re coordinating AI/squads or doing “grown-up stuff” without being the full commander.
- **Commander**: campaign management. If you’re not planning to do this, ignore the commander section entirely: **[Commander](../commander/README.md)**.

## One honest tip

Pick the role that matches what you will actually do in the next hour, not what sounds cool.
