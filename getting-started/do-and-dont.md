# Do / Don’t

This is the “save your campaign from pain” page.

## Do

- **Do** travel with a plan: vehicle + extraction route + rally point.
- **Do** stash useful vehicles and loot instead of leaving it in the field.
- **Do** grab intel when you can (it’s the fuel for good targets).
- **Do** ask before spending faction money/HR (unless your server culture says otherwise).

## Don’t

- **Don’t** turn every contact into a stand-up fight “until we win”. Sometimes winning is *leaving alive*.
- **Don’t** shoot civilians for fun (unless your server is doing a chaos run). It usually backfires.
- **Don’t** drag enemies back to HQ and start a base siege by accident.
- **Don’t** take the only logistics truck and flip it into the ocean.

## If you only remember one thing

Antistasi rewards **momentum and restraint**, not “maximum body count”.
