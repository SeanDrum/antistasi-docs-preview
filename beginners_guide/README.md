# Beginners Guide

This is the casual “how do I actually play this?” guide.

If you want to compare tone/structure, the older docs site is here:

# Setup UI

This is the **first screen you see after loading into the scenario**.

Before the campaign actually starts, you (or your host/admin) need to set up:

- what save to load (or whether you’re starting fresh)
- which factions are in the war
- the campaign parameters (difficulty/limits/tuning)

It has three main tabs:

- **Load game**
- **Factions**
- **Params**

## Load game tab (starting, copying, loading)

You’ll see a list of existing saves (if any), plus controls for starting something new.

Things you can do here:

- **Load an existing save** (select it, then start).
- **Create a new game** (check “new game”, set a name, start).
- **Copy a game** (new game + copy option) if you want a “branch” of an older campaign.
- **Load old params** (when starting a new game): reuse parameter settings from a selected save.
- **Use new namespace** (new game): used for save/import compatibility and cross-platform differences.
- **Set HQ position** (new game): choose where HQ starts — see **[Set HQ position (HQ placement)](../reference/set-hq-position.md)**.
- **Export / import** (only available for compatible saves).
- **Delete / rename** saves.

### Set HQ position

See **[Set HQ position (HQ placement)](../reference/set-hq-position.md)**.

## Factions tab (who’s fighting)

Before you pick factions, you should understand the campaign **game mode**, because it changes what “Occupants” and “Invaders” mean.

Antistasi supports:



- **Reb vs Gov**: simplest mode. One main enemy (“the government/occupants”). Good for learning, smaller groups, or “one clear front line”.
- **Reb vs Gov + Inv**: two enemy factions exist. You’ll still mostly feel pressure from the government, but the invaders add extra chaos and extra threats depending on where they are on the map.
- **Reb vs Gov vs Inv**: full three-way war. Expect the most unpredictability and “stuff happening without you”. Great for emergent fights, but it’s the least beginner-friendly.

You should probably determine the mode you want on the param tab before picking factions. Once you've done that you can determine which faction(s) you face against and who you play as.

- **Rebels** (you)
- **Civilians**
- **Occupants** (main government force)
- **Invaders** (secondary enemy faction depending on mode)

Helpful options in this tab:

- **Switch enemy sides**: swap occupants/invaders around.
- **Override side limits**: loosen restrictions on which factions can be picked for each enemy slot.
- **Override camo limits**: ignore climate/camo constraints.
- **Show missing mods**: show factions even if required addons aren’t loaded (usually greyed out).
- **DLC / Addons toggle**: switch between DLC and “addon vehicles” lists.
- **Info panel**: shows faction lore + dependencies so you know what you’re selecting.

## Params tab (campaign rules)

This tab is a big list of “server rules” / tuning options.

Example: **Game Mode** is explicitly marked “Do NOT change this mid mission”.

# Map markers (quick meaning)

This section is intentionally short. For Antistasi, the question is always: **“What does this marker mean for the campaign?”**

- **Towns / cities**: population/support and the “hearts and minds” part of the war.
- **Outposts**: military presence you’ll fight over a lot.
- **Airbases**: heavy targets and late-game “big wins”.
- **Seaports**: strategic on island/coastal maps.
- **Factories / resources**: long-term sustainment targets.
- **Radio towers**: high-value “information war” targets that are often worth hitting early.

---

# Towns

Towns are where you get support (or lose it). Fighting badly in towns can make everything harder later.

---

# Info bar

Antistasi surfaces a lot of campaign state (money, HR, aggression, etc.). Learn where to check it so you’re not guessing.

---

# Your Headquarters (HQ)

HQ is your “home base” for a lot of campaign actions. Don’t turn it into a permanent battlefield by dragging enemies back to it.

---

# Commander and member functionality

Some actions are restricted to the commander/admin roles. If you never command, you can ignore most of the management—but it’s still useful to understand what the commander is trying to do.

---

# Missions

Mission types commonly include:

- Conquest
- Destroy
- Assassination
- Convoy ambush
- Rescue
- Logistics
- Support

Pick missions that match your group size and patience.

---

# Undercover and how to use it

Undercover is great for scouting and getting into position before you start shooting. Assume it will eventually break; plan your exit.

---

# Vehicles

Vehicles are campaign progress. Treat them like valuable assets, not disposable taxis.

---

# Victory condition

Winning is usually about **controlling key strategic locations** and **having enough population support**—not just painting the whole map your color.

---

# Walkthrough (very short)

- **Early**: get gear and intel, stay alive, don’t start base sieges.
- **Mid**: take a strategic point, defend it, build momentum.
- **Late**: airbases and big pushes—expect heavy resistance.
