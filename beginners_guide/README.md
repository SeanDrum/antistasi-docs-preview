# Beginners Guide

This is the casual “how do I actually play this?” guide.

# Setup UI

This is the **first screen you see after loading into the scenario**.

Before the campaign actually starts, you (or your host/admin) need to set up:

- what save to load (or whether you’re starting fresh)
- which factions are in the war
- the campaign parameters (difficulty/limits/tuning)

It has three main tabs:

- **Load game**
- **Factions**
- **Params**

## Load game tab (starting, copying, loading)

You’ll see a list of existing saves (if any), plus controls for starting something new.

Things you can do here:

- **Load an existing save** (select it, then start).
- **Create a new game** (check “new game”, set a name, start).
- **Copy a game** (new game + copy option) if you want a “branch” of an older campaign.
- **Load old params** (when starting a new game): reuse parameter settings from a selected save.
- **Use new namespace** (new game): used for save/import compatibility and cross-platform differences.
- **Set HQ position** (new game): choose where HQ starts (see below).
- **Export / import** (only available for compatible saves).
- **Delete / rename** saves.

### Set HQ position

When you pick HQ start position on the map, the game will show “danger zones” and reject bad positions.
In practice:

- You **can’t** place HQ **within 500m** of major markers/locations (the map will show red hatched circles).
- You **can’t** place HQ in water.
- You **can’t** place HQ outside the map bounds.

What *this means for players*:

- Don’t overthink “perfect HQ”. You can move later, but a good start helps.
- Pick somewhere that’s **not obvious**, with **natural cover**, and **multiple exit routes**.
- Avoid placing HQ right next to the “main roads everyone drives on” unless you like surprise drive-bys.

## Factions tab (who’s fighting)

You pick:

- **Rebels** (you)
- **Civilians**
- **Occupants** (main government force)
- **Invaders** (secondary enemy faction depending on mode)

Helpful options in this tab:

- **Switch enemy sides**: swap occupants/invaders around.
- **Override side limits**: loosen restrictions on which factions can be picked for each enemy slot.
- **Override camo limits**: ignore climate/camo constraints.
- **Show missing mods**: show factions even if required addons aren’t loaded (usually greyed out).
- **DLC / Addons toggle**: switch between DLC and “addon vehicles” lists.
- **Info panel**: shows faction lore + dependencies so you know what you’re selecting.

## Params tab (campaign rules)

This tab is a big list of “server rules” / tuning options.

Example: **Game Mode** is explicitly marked “Do NOT change this mid mission”.

---

# Game modes

Antistasi supports:

- **Reb vs Gov vs Inv** (three-way war)
- **Reb vs Gov + Inv** (two enemies, but not fighting each other the same way)
- **Reb vs Gov** (single enemy)

Pick the mode you want at campaign start and leave it alone afterwards.

---

# Map markers (quick meaning)

This section is intentionally short. For Antistasi, the question is always: **“What does this marker mean for the campaign?”**

- **Towns / cities**: population/support and the “hearts and minds” part of the war.
- **Outposts**: military presence you’ll fight over a lot.
- **Airbases**: heavy targets and late-game “big wins”.
- **Seaports**: strategic on island/coastal maps.
- **Factories / resources**: long-term sustainment targets.
- **Radio towers**: high-value “information war” targets that are often worth hitting early.

---

# Towns

Towns are where you get support (or lose it). Fighting badly in towns can make everything harder later.

---

# Info bar

Antistasi surfaces a lot of campaign state (money, HR, aggression, etc.). Learn where to check it so you’re not guessing.

---

# Your Headquarters (HQ)

HQ is your “home base” for a lot of campaign actions. Don’t turn it into a permanent battlefield by dragging enemies back to it.

---

# Commander and member functionality

Some actions are restricted to the commander/admin roles. If you never command, you can ignore most of the management—but it’s still useful to understand what the commander is trying to do.

---

# Missions

Mission types commonly include:

- Conquest
- Destroy
- Assassination
- Convoy ambush
- Rescue
- Logistics
- Support

Pick missions that match your group size and patience.

---

# Undercover and how to use it

Undercover is great for scouting and getting into position before you start shooting. Assume it will eventually break; plan your exit.

---

# HQ placement (practical advice)

This is the “where should we put it?” advice that actually saves you pain.

Placing your HQ correctly is critical to the success of your resistance.

You want your HQ to be both concealed and close enough to strategic zones for missions.

## Strong practical rules (worth following)

- **Always place your HQ on or near the end of a road.** You will want all of your vehicles to be on a road so you can go undercover. Going off road may get you spotted.
- **Never place your HQ in between towns or other strategic zones.** The enemy sends patrols in between zones and may spot your HQ.
- **Place your HQ inside a compound and put Petros inside a building** for added protection.
- **Place your HQ within 4km of strategic zones so you can get missions.** Any area 4km or more from your HQ will not be available for missions (distance can be changed through parameters).

## What makes a good HQ spot

- **Cover**: trees, rocks, small hills. You want concealment from casual spotting.
- **Space**: enough flat-ish ground to park vehicles and not block yourself in.
- **Access**: close enough to roads to move supplies, but not *on* a road where AI/players constantly pass.
- **Escape routes**: at least two directions to leave quickly when things go wrong.

## What makes a bad HQ spot

- **Too exposed**: big open fields with no cover.
- **Too cramped**: deep forest with no room to park/build.
- **Too “central” to trouble**: near a lot of enemy activity, where every small mistake turns into a base siege.

## A simple rule of thumb

If your HQ feels like “a place we can chill between ops”, you’re probably fine.
If it feels like “we’re constantly fighting here”, it’s probably in a bad location.

# Vehicles

Vehicles are campaign progress. Treat them like valuable assets, not disposable taxis.

---

# Victory condition

Winning is usually about **controlling key strategic locations** and **having enough population support**—not just painting the whole map your color.

---

# Walkthrough (very short)

- **Early**: get gear and intel, stay alive, don’t start base sieges.
- **Mid**: take a strategic point, defend it, build momentum.
- **Late**: airbases and big pushes—expect heavy resistance.
