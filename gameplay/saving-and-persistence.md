# Saving & persistence

Antistasi campaigns are persistent. That means the server can save campaign state and later load it again.

## The important part (for players)

- Ask your server/commander what their save routine is.
- If you’re an admin/commander, saving is usually done from the **Battle Menu** under **Commander** or **Admin** tabs.

## Why this matters

- Updates/restarts happen.
- Persistence keeps the campaign from resetting to “fresh rebels” every session.
