# The campaign loop (the “what are we doing?” page)

Antistasi is a long campaign where your side grows from “scrappy rebels” into “we can actually hold ground”.

In practice, you’ll spend your time doing a repeating loop:

1. **Pick a target** (usually based on the map: cities, outposts, resources, etc.).
2. **Prep** (gear, vehicle, rally point, exit route).
3. **Hit it** (mission, raid, ambush, sabotage, battle).
4. **Extract** (alive, with loot/intel).
5. **Consolidate** (stash vehicles, manage garrisons, shift focus).

## What “progress” usually looks like

- Early game: **loot + intel + small missions**.
- Mid game: **taking/holding key locations** and building reliable logistics.
- Late game: bigger pushes, more enemy attention, more “combined arms” fights.

## What makes it feel harder over time

The more impact you have, the more the enemy reacts. That’s part of the fun.
