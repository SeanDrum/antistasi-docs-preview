# Undercover

Undercover is a playstyle mechanic that lets you move and operate with less attention *when you meet the conditions*.

## What it’s good for

- Getting into position before a raid.
- Scouting towns/roads without instantly starting a war.
- Smuggling yourself (and sometimes gear/vehicles) through hostile areas.

## What usually breaks undercover

- Doing obvious hostile actions (shooting, explosives, etc.).
- Being in the wrong vehicle or wearing the wrong kit (depends on server/modset).
- Getting too close to enemies who have reason to be suspicious.

## Practical tips

- Treat it like stealth: have a plan for when it inevitably breaks.
- Combine it with **fast extraction**, not “stand and fight”.
