# Missions

Missions are the “structured content” that pushes the campaign forward. Most servers let you request missions from the scenario UI.

## The common mission categories

- **Conquest**: fight for control of an area/objective.
- **Destroy**: blow up a specific asset.
- **Assassination**: remove a high-value target.
- **Convoy ambush**: hit a moving convoy (plan your exit).
- **Rescue**: extract a friendly/captive.
- **Logistics**: move supplies/vehicles to enable the campaign.
- **Support**: actions that help the team (varies by server/settings).

## How to choose a mission that won’t waste your night

- Small group? Prefer **Destroy / Assassination / Rescue**.
- Want a big fight? Pick **Conquest** and commit, but have fallback plans.
- Want “quiet progress”? Do **Logistics**.
