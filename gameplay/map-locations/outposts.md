# Outposts

Outposts are military points on the map that influence local control and enemy presence.

## Why you care

- Outposts often act like “anchors” for enemy response in an area.
- They are common targets for **Conquest** style gameplay.

## Practical tips

- Scout first. Outposts can be much heavier than they look.
- If you take one, expect the area to stay hot for a while.
- Don’t over-commit: an outpost win is pointless if you lose every vehicle doing it.
