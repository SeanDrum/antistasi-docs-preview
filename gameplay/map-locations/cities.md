# Cities

Cities are where the civilian population lives, and they’re central to “winning hearts and minds”.

## Why you care

- Cities are tied to **support** and campaign momentum.
- Fighting inside cities tends to **snowball** quickly (reinforcements, collateral, chaos).

## How players can help

- Do missions that improve your position around the city.
- Avoid unnecessary civilian casualties (if your server isn’t doing a chaos run).
- Be ready for “city battle” style fights later in the campaign.
