# Radio towers

Radio towers are “special” locations that matter beyond just a firefight.

## What players should know

- **They are high-value targets**: expect attention if you attack one.
- **They affect the information war**: towers are tied to intel/awareness mechanics in Antistasi.
- **They are often worth doing early**, because they can make later operations smoother.

## Practical tips

- Plan your exit before you start shooting (towers tend to escalate).
- Bring explosives and a way to deal with vehicles.
- If your group is small, treat it like a raid: hit fast, leave fast.
