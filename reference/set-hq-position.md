# Set HQ position (HQ placement)

This page is about choosing your starting HQ location during campaign setup.

## What the game will reject

When you pick HQ start position on the map, the game will show “danger zones” and reject bad positions.

- You **can’t** place HQ **within 500m** of major markers/locations (the map will show red hatched circles).
- You **can’t** place HQ in water.
- You **can’t** place HQ outside the map bounds.

## Why it matters

Placing your HQ correctly is critical to the success of your resistance.

You want your HQ to be both concealed and close enough to strategic zones for missions.

## Strong practical rules (worth following)

- **Always place your HQ on or near the end of a road.** You will want all of your vehicles to be on a road so you can go undercover. Going off road may get you spotted.
- **Never place your HQ in between towns or other strategic zones.** The enemy sends patrols in between zones and may spot your HQ.
- **Place your HQ inside a compound and put Petros inside a building** for added protection.
- **Place your HQ within 4km of strategic zones so you can get missions.** Any area 4km or more from your HQ will not be available for missions (distance can be changed through parameters).

## What makes a good HQ spot

- **Cover**: trees, rocks, small hills. You want concealment from casual spotting.
- **Space**: enough flat-ish ground to park vehicles and not block yourself in.
- **Access**: close enough to roads to move supplies, but not *on* a road where AI/players constantly pass.
- **Escape routes**: at least two directions to leave quickly when things go wrong.

## What makes a bad HQ spot

- **Too exposed**: big open fields with no cover.
- **Too cramped**: deep forest with no room to park/build.
- **Too “central” to trouble**: near a lot of enemy activity, where every small mistake turns into a base siege.

## A simple rule of thumb

If your HQ feels like “a place we can chill between ops”, you’re probably fine.
If it feels like “we’re constantly fighting here”, it’s probably in a bad location.
