# Controls & menus

Antistasi adds a bunch of scenario UI on top of Arma.

## Battle Menu

This is your main hub for campaign info and actions.

- **War Status**: a “what’s going on?” view (aggression/resources/money/HR/intel feed).
- **Commander / Admin tabs**: extra actions (often including save/load and campaign management).

## Role selection

Role perks and responsibilities live here. You can be a normal role (rifleman/medic/engineer) or leadership roles (TL/Commander).

## Options / Remarks

Antistasi also adds entries to the in-game pause/interrupt menu for scenario options and sending remarks (server feature).
