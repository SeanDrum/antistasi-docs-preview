## Towns and Cities

**Marker Type**: Rectangular area markers with city names

**Primary Functions:**
- **Passive Income**: Generate money and HR (Human Resources) every ~10 minutes based on population and rebel support
- **Hearts and Minds**: The foundation of your population support system
- **Victory Condition**: Contribute to the population support requirement for victory

**Income Mechanics:**
- Income is calculated based on the square root of the city's population multiplied by the rebel support percentage
- **Controlled cities** (under your control): Generate **100%** of their income value
- **Uncontrolled cities** (enemy-controlled): Generate **50%** of their income value, but still contribute based on support level
- Both money and HR scale with population size and support percentage

**Strategic Importance:**
- Cities are your primary source of HR for recruiting soldiers
- Higher rebel support means more income from each city
- Controlling cities doubles their contribution to your victory condition population count
- Cities can be destroyed by enemy punishment attacks or orbital strikes, permanently removing them from the map

**Radio Tower Synergy:**
- When a nearby radio tower is destroyed or under your control, all hearts-and-minds actions in that city have **double effectiveness**
- This makes radio towers critical for building support quickly

**Garrison Requirements:**
- Cities have police stations that spawn enemy units
- Garrison size scales with city population (approximately 2 × √(population/2))
- Cities on the frontline require larger garrisons

## Resource Sites

**Marker Type**: Rock/mining icon markers

**Primary Functions:**
- **Direct Income**: Generate a flat amount of money every ~10 minutes
- **Economic Foundation**: Provide reliable, predictable income

**Income Mechanics:**
- Each resource site you control generates **300 money** per income cycle (~10 minutes)
- This income is **multiplied by your factory count**: 1 factory = 1.25×, 2 factories = 1.5×, 3 factories = 1.75×, etc.
- Formula: 300 × (1 + 0.25 × number of factories)
- Destroyed resource sites stop generating income until rebuilt

**Strategic Importance:**
- Resource sites provide immediate, consistent income that doesn't depend on population support
- They're excellent early-game targets because the income is guaranteed once captured
- The factory multiplier makes them scale well into the mid and late game
- Losing a resource site means losing that income stream, making them high-value targets for enemy counterattacks

**Garrison Requirements:**
- Resource sites typically have smaller garrisons than airbases or major outposts
- Garrison size scales with marker size and frontline status
- Expect 1-5 groups of enemies depending on size and location

## Factories

**Marker Type**: Installation/industrial icon markers

**Primary Functions:**
- **Income Multiplier**: Increase the income generated by resource sites
- **Economic Scaling**: Make your resource income grow as you capture more factories

**Multiplier Mechanics:**
- Each factory you control adds a **0.25× multiplier** to all resource site income
- This multiplier stacks: 1 factory = 1.25× total, 2 factories = 1.5× total, 3 factories = 1.75× total, etc.
- Destroyed factories don't contribute to the multiplier until rebuilt
- The multiplier applies to **all** resource sites you control, not just nearby ones

**Strategic Importance:**
- Factories are force multipliers for your economy
- Early factories provide modest benefits, but they become extremely valuable as you capture more resource sites
- A single factory can increase your total resource income by 25% across all sites
- Prioritize factories once you have 2-3 resource sites to maximize the multiplier effect

**Example:**
- With 3 resource sites and 2 factories:
  - Base income: 300 × 3 = 900 per cycle
  - With multiplier: 900 × 1.5 = 1,350 per cycle
  - The 2 factories add 450 money per cycle total

**Garrison Requirements:**
- Factories have moderate garrison sizes, similar to resource sites
- Size scales with marker dimensions and frontline proximity

## Seaports

**Marker Type**: Port/harbor icon markers

**Primary Functions:**
- **Vehicle Discounts**: Reduce the purchase price of vehicles (on maps with multiple seaports)
- **Fast Travel**: Serve as fast travel destinations
- **Support Boost**: Provide a small multiplier to support-related income

**Discount Mechanics (Maps with 4+ Seaports):**
- Each friendly seaport reduces vehicle purchase prices by **5%**
- Maximum of **6 seaports** count toward discounts (30% maximum discount)
- Formula: Price reduction = 5% × (number of friendly seaports, capped at 6)
- Example: With 4 friendly seaports, vehicles cost 20% less

**Alternative System (Maps with 3 or Fewer Seaports):**
- On maps with 3 or fewer seaports, discounts are based on war tier instead
- Discount starts at war tier 4 and increases by 0.5× per tier above that
- This system doesn't depend on seaport control

**Support Boost:**
- Seaports provide a 0.5× multiplier to support-related bonuses
- This affects certain hearts-and-minds mechanics

**Strategic Importance:**
- Seaports are economically valuable on coastal/island maps with multiple ports
- The vehicle discount can save significant money when purchasing expensive vehicles like helicopters or tanks
- They serve as strategic staging points for naval operations
- Fast travel capability makes them useful for rapid deployment

**Garrison Requirements:**
- Seaports have garrison requirements similar to outposts
- Size scales with marker size and frontline status

## Radio Towers (Antennas)

**Marker Type**: Not directly marked, but associated with outposts and some cities

**Primary Functions:**
- **Hearts and Minds Multiplier**: Double the effectiveness of support-building actions in nearby cities
- **Intel Generation**: Increase frequency of intel reveals and warnings
- **Radio Interference**: Affect radio communication ranges when enemy-controlled

**Hearts and Minds Effect:**
- When a radio tower is **destroyed** or **under your control**, all positive support changes in nearby cities are **doubled**
- This applies to missions, killing enemies in cities, and other support-building activities
- Enemy-controlled radio towers provide no bonus to your support efforts
- This makes destroying or capturing radio towers one of the highest priorities in the early game

**Intel Benefits:**
- Radio towers increase the frequency of intel generation
- Intel includes enemy vehicle reveals, warnings about incoming strikes, and other tactical information
- More radio towers under your control = more reliable intelligence

**Radio Interference:**
- Enemy-controlled radio towers within 1000 meters can interfere with your radio communications
- This affects both TFAR and ACRE radio systems
- Your own radio towers can boost your communication range

**Strategic Importance:**
- Radio towers are **critical early-game objectives** because they dramatically speed up support building
- Destroying enemy radio towers is often easier than capturing them and provides the same support bonus
- They're often located at outposts, making those outposts extra valuable targets
- Prioritize radio towers near cities where you're actively building support

**Destruction:**
- Radio towers can be destroyed with explosives (C4, satchel charges)
- Destroyed towers can be rebuilt by the enemy, but this takes time and resources
- Destroyed towers provide the same support bonus as captured ones

## Airbases

**Marker Type**: Flag markers (NATO/CSAT flags)

**Primary Functions:**
- **Bomb Run Generation**: Generate airstrike points over time
- **Fast Travel**: Serve as fast travel destinations
- **Victory Condition**: Must control all airbases to win
- **Strategic Staging**: Major military installations

**Bomb Run Mechanics:**
- Each airbase you control generates **0.25 bomb runs** per income cycle (~10 minutes)
- Bomb runs accumulate over time and are capped at **(4 + war tier × 2)**
- Example: At war tier 3, maximum bomb runs = 4 + (3 × 2) = 10
- Bomb runs are used to call in airstrikes via the support system

**Strategic Importance:**
- Airbases are the **highest-value strategic targets** in the campaign
- They're required for victory: you must control **every airbase** on the map
- They provide ongoing airstrike capability, which is essential for late-game operations
- Enemy airbases are staging points for enemy air attacks against you
- Denying airbases to the enemy reduces their ability to launch airstrikes

**Capture Requirements:**
- Airbases can only be captured at **war tier 3 or higher**
- They have the largest garrisons of any marker type
- Expect 2-11 groups of enemies depending on size and frontline status
- Airbases on the frontline receive additional garrison reinforcements

**Counterattack Risk:**
- Airbases are high-priority targets for enemy counterattacks
- Expect serious resistance when capturing and defending them
- You'll need significant forces, anti-air assets, and anti-tank weapons

**Fast Travel:**
- Airbases serve as fast travel destinations
- Fast travel requires no enemies within 500 meters of the destination
- Useful for rapid deployment across the map

## Outposts

**Marker Type**: Bunker/military base icon markers

**Primary Functions:**
- **Garrison Points**: Can be garrisoned with your forces for defense
- **Fast Travel**: Serve as fast travel destinations
- **Frontline Control**: Establish and maintain control of territory
- **Radio Tower Locations**: Some outposts are associated with radio towers

**Strategic Importance:**
- Outposts are **military footholds** that extend your control over territory
- They remove enemy garrison anchors in an area, reducing local enemy presence
- They provide defensible positions you can fortify and garrison
- Outposts with radio towers are especially valuable targets
- They're common early-to-mid game objectives

**Garrison Requirements:**
- Outpost garrisons scale with marker size (typically 1-7 groups)
- Outposts with radio towers receive additional garrison (typically +2 groups)
- Frontline outposts receive +2 additional groups
- You'll need to garrison captured outposts to hold them against counterattacks

**Fast Travel:**
- Outposts serve as fast travel destinations
- Fast travel works between airbases, outposts, and seaports
- Requires no enemies within 500 meters

**Radio Tower Association:**
- Some outposts have radio towers nearby or within their area
- These outposts are marked by the presence of communication towers
- Capturing or destroying the radio tower provides the hearts-and-minds bonus
- This makes these outposts higher-priority targets

**Fortification:**
- Outposts can be fortified using the builder system (Engineer or Team Leader roles)
- Static weapons, cover, and defensive positions can be placed
- Fortifications help defend against counterattacks

## Minor Sites (Roadblocks and Camps)

**Marker Type**: Small control markers (not major strategic points)

**Primary Functions:**
- **Area Control**: Establish presence in remote areas
- **Patrol Spawning**: Influence where enemy patrols spawn
- **Tactical Positions**: Provide small defensive advantages

**Roadblocks:**
- Located on roads
- Smaller garrisons (typically 6 soldiers)
- Can be captured to control road networks
- Affect enemy vehicle movement and patrol routes

**Camps:**
- Located off-road in remote areas
- Slightly larger garrisons (typically 8 soldiers)
- Often found in wilderness or mountainous areas
- Less strategically important but can affect local control

**Strategic Importance:**
- Minor sites are lower priority than major markers
- They can be useful for controlling specific areas or routes
- Capturing them reduces enemy presence in remote regions
- They're often captured incidentally while moving between major objectives
