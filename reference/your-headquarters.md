# Your Headquarters (HQ)

This page details what regular players (non-commanders) can do at your headquarters. HQ is your home base and the primary location for managing your equipment, vehicles, and team.

## Overview

HQ is where you'll spend much of your downtime between operations. It contains several key objects:
- **The Flag** (`flagX`): Used for recruiting units and buying vehicles
- **The Vehicle Box** (`vehicleBox`): Access point for arsenal, garage, vehicle purchases, and unit restoration
- **Petros**: The rebel leader NPC who provides missions (members only)

**Important**: Don't bring enemies back to HQ. Treat it as a safe haven—if you're being chased, lead enemies away before returning.

## Recruiting Units

**Location**: At the flag

**How it works**: You can recruit AI squadmates to join your group using Human Resources (HR) and your personal money.

**Requirements**:
- You must be the leader of your group (leader of the group you're in)
- You need at least 1 HR available (check the info bar for current HR)
- You need enough personal money to cover the unit cost
- The unit type must have weapons available in the arsenal (unlocked or in stock)
- No enemies nearby (within the enemy near distance parameter)
- Not on a cooldown (there's a brief cooldown between recruits)

**Unit types available**:
- Militiaman (basic rifleman)
- Autorifleman (machine gunner)
- Grenadier
- Medic
- Engineer
- Team Leader
- Other specialized roles (varies by faction)

**Cost**: Each unit type has a different cost in personal money, plus 1 HR per unit. Unit costs are determined by your faction's equipment and are displayed in the recruitment interface.

**Tips**:
- Recruited units will automatically follow you and join your group
- You can equip recruited units with gear from the arsenal (access it near the vehicle box)
- Units will inherit your faction's current equipment pool
- You can have up to 9 units in your group total (including yourself)
- If your group is full, you'll need to dismiss or lose units before recruiting more

## Accessing the Arsenal

**Location**: At the vehicle box (when on foot)

**How it works**: The arsenal contains all weapons, gear, and equipment you've collected during the campaign. Interact with the vehicle box while on foot to open the arsenal interface.

**Item collection**:
- Equipment looted from enemies and placed in the vehicle box is automatically added to the arsenal
- Intel missions can unlock weapons directly
- Starting faction equipment is available immediately

**Unlocking system**:
- When you collect enough copies of an item (default 25), it becomes **permanently unlocked** with unlimited availability
- Items below the unlock threshold have finite quantities—take them and they're gone until you loot more
- Members can take any item regardless of quantity; regular players may be restricted until sufficient copies are available

**What you can customize**:
- Primary and secondary weapons
- Pistols and launchers
- Weapon attachments (optics, grips, suppressors, bipods)
- Uniforms, vests, and backpacks
- Headgear (helmets, caps, etc.)
- NVGs and goggles
- Magazines and ammunition
- Explosives (grenades, mines, etc.)
- Utility items (medical supplies, tools, radios)

**Tips**:
- The arsenal is central to progression—loot everything you can and bring it back to HQ
- Unlocked items can be taken by any player in unlimited quantities
- Limited items are shared across all players, so coordinate with your team
- Keep collecting enemy equipment to unlock better gear over time

## Accessing the Garage

**Location**: At the vehicle box

**How it works**: The garage system lets you store, retrieve, and manage vehicles. Vehicles stored in the garage can be accessed from any friendly garage location (HQ, captured airbases, outposts, seaports).

**Storing vehicles**:
- Drive a vehicle near the vehicle box and interact with it to store it
- Stored vehicles are preserved and can be retrieved later
- This protects valuable vehicles from being lost or destroyed

**Retrieving vehicles**:
- Open the garage interface from the vehicle box
- Browse your stored vehicles
- Select a vehicle to retrieve it nearby

**Tips**:
- Use the garage to protect captured enemy vehicles
- Store vehicles when you're done with them rather than leaving them scattered around
- You can access stored vehicles from any friendly garage, making vehicle management much easier
- The garage interface shows vehicle details including type, damage status, and loadout

## Buying Vehicles

**Location**: At the flag or vehicle box

**How it works**: Purchase vehicles using your personal money. This is how you expand your motor pool when you need specific vehicles for missions.

**Vehicle categories**:
- **Civilian vehicles**: Cars, trucks, boats, helicopters (good for undercover operations)
- **Military vehicles**: Offroads, trucks, APCs, static weapons
- **Other**: Specialized vehicles and equipment

**Requirements**:
- Sufficient personal money to cover the purchase cost
- No enemies nearby (within the enemy near distance parameter)
- Vehicle must be available for your faction

**Tips**:
- Vehicle prices can be reduced by controlling seaports (on maps with multiple seaports)
- Civilian vehicles are essential for undercover operations
- Static weapons (mortars, AT guns, AA guns) can be purchased and deployed at strategic locations
- Consider buying vehicles that complement your current arsenal and mission needs

## Restoring Units (Vehicle Box Restore)

**Location**: At the vehicle box

**How it works**: The restore action heals and restores all rebel units (players and AI) near HQ, clears vehicle "reported" status, and can refuel/rearm/repair vehicles if the garage has those capabilities.

**What it does**:
- **Heals all players and AI** within 50 meters of HQ (full health, removes injuries)
- **Restores stamina/fatigue** to zero for all nearby units
- **Clears "reported" status** from vehicles within 150 meters (allows them to go undercover again)
- **Resets compromised status** (allows units to go undercover again)
- **Refuels vehicles** (if the garage has a fuel source stored)
- **Rearms vehicles** (if the garage has an ammo source stored)
- **Repairs vehicles** (if the garage has a repair source stored)

**Requirements**:
- Can only be used once every 30 seconds (cooldown timer)
- Must be at the vehicle box
- Works automatically for all friendly units in range

**Tips**:
- Use this after returning from missions to heal up your team and vehicles
- The restore action is free—use it frequently to maintain your forces
- If the garage has repair/fuel/ammo sources, your vehicles will be fully restored
- This is especially useful after intense combat operations

## Requesting Missions

**Location**: From Petros (the rebel leader NPC)

**How it works**: If you're a member of the server, you can request specific mission types from Petros. This gives you more control over what missions become available.

**Requirements**:
- You must be a member (not just a regular player)
- Petros must not be moving (HQ is not being relocated)
- The mission type must not already be active

**Available mission types**:
- **AS (Air Support)**: Missions involving airports, cities, or special operations sites
- **CONVOY**: Intercept and destroy enemy supply convoys
- **DES (Destroy)**: Destroy specific enemy assets or infrastructure
- **CON (Conquest)**: Capture outposts, resources, roadblocks, or other strategic points
- **LOG (Logistics)**: Supply and logistics-related missions
- **SUPP (Support)**: Support and assistance missions
- **RES (Rescue)**: Rescue missions for captured personnel

**How to request**:
- Interact with Petros
- Select "Request Mission" from the interaction menu
- Choose the mission type you want
- Petros will attempt to generate a mission of that type within the mission distance from HQ

**Tips**:
- Mission requests can only create missions that are appropriate for the current war tier
- If no suitable locations exist for a mission type, Petros will tell you
- Requesting missions gives you more agency in directing the campaign's focus
- Coordinate with your team to avoid requesting duplicate mission types

## General Tips for HQ Usage

- **Keep HQ safe**: Don't lead enemies back to your base. If you're being chased, deal with them elsewhere first.
- **Coordinate with your team**: The arsenal and garage are shared resources—communicate with teammates about what you're taking or storing.
- **Regular maintenance**: Use the restore action frequently to keep your team and vehicles in top condition.
- **Plan your loadout**: Before heading out on missions, make sure you have the right gear from the arsenal.
- **Manage your vehicles**: Store vehicles you're not using to keep them safe and organized.
- **Recruit strategically**: Only recruit units when you need them and can afford them—HR is a shared resource.
- **Check your funds**: Make sure you have enough personal money before attempting to buy vehicles or recruit units.
